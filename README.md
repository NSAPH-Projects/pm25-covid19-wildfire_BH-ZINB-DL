This is the repository for public available code and data to reproduce our analyses.

#### Key Results
![image1](https://github.com/xiaodan-zhou/covid_wildfire/blob/master/output/pct_increases.png)
Posterior distribution of percentage increase in COVID-19 cases (left) and COVID-19 deaths (right) associated with a daily increase of 10Î¼g/m3 in PM2.5 separately for lag 0 up to lag 14, averaged across 92 counties in California, Oregan and Washington. 

#### Data
We acquired and linked publicly available daily data on PM2.5, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and other confounding factors for 92 western U.S. counties that were affected by the 2020 wildfires. All data for analyses were cleaned and stored in [/data/moddat_Feb2021.csv](https://github.com/xiaodan-zhou/covid_wildfire/blob/master/data/moddat_Feb2021.csv). 

#### Code
coming soon
